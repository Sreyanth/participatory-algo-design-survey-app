      For the 20 predictions, you can choose to use a statistical model that
      will give you predictions based on other students’ performance or use your
      own predictions.
    </p>

    <p>
      The model is designed to predict each student’s reading test score (as a
      percentile) using the same information that you will receive. The model is
      based on data from thousands of high school sophomores. This will be a
      sophisticated model, put together and optimized through a program written
      by the research team.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="important-check">{{ attention_text }}</span> You will then
      review the performance of the statistical model and decide if you want to
      use the model or not. You can use and modify the predictions however you
      like to form your official predictions. If you choose to use your own
      estimation, you will receive the same information you pick and form your
      own official predictions. You will pick the information to use for the prediction task
      regardless you would like to use the statistical model or use
      your own estimation.
