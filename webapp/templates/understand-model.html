    <h3>The Statistical Model</h3>

    <p class="lead">
      In addition to the forecasts that you produce, there are also forecasts of
      each percentile that were produced by a statistical model. The model is
      designed to forecast each student’s percentile. The model is based on data
      from thousands of high school sophomores, and it uses the same information
      that you will receive. The model does not have any additional information
      that you will not receive. This is a sophisticated model, put together by
      the research team.
    </p>

    <p class="lead">
      Across all students, the model’s estimate is off by 19.7 percentiles on
      average. Although this is the model’s average performance, it may perform
      better or worse than this for the small set of students that you will be
      asked about in this experiment.
