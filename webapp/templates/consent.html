      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>
        You will be asked to complete predictive tasks for hypothetical settings
        in education using either your own judgement or that of a statistical
        model. The tasks are built using publicly available data and contain no
        sensitive information. Your work product and responses will not impact
        the relevant policies. You might want to participate in the research if
        you want to learn more about algorithmic decision support systems. You
        might not want to participate in the research if you feel uncomfortable
        with the settings of the experiment.
      </p>

      <h4>Purpose</h4>
      <p>
        The main purpose of the research is to study participants’ preference
        for using statistical models. We will perform statistical analysis to
        identify and extract patterns in the answers to this survey.

          We cannot tell you the full purpose of the research in advance, but
          we’ll debrief you at the end of the study. You will have the
          opportunity to ask questions.
        </strong>

      <h4>Procedures</h4>
      <p>
        The study will take approximately 30 minutes and no more than an hour to
        complete. In each scenario, your task is to predict the percentile of
        reading score for a student. You will be presented with information
        about the student. You will repeat this task for 20 students.

      <h4>Compensation &amp; Costs</h4>

      {% if user_group == 'change-outcome-proposed-payment' %}

      <p>
        You will be paid a flat rate of $1 per participation. Additionally, you
        will be awarded a bonus based on the accuracy of your predictions for 20
        students. The accuracy is calculated as the average of the differences
        between your predictions and the students’ actual percentiles. The bonus
        rule is as below:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          $5 — within 14 percentiles of students’ actual percentiles on average
        </li>

          $4 — within 17 percentiles of students’ actual percentiles on average
        </li>
