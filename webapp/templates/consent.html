      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>
        You will be asked to complete predictive tasks for hypothetical settings
        in education using either your own judgement or that of a statistical
        model. The tasks are built using publicly available data and contain no
        sensitive information. Your work product and responses will not impact
        the relevant policies. You might want to participate in the research if
        you want to learn more about algorithmic decision support systems. You
        might not want to participate in the research if you feel uncomfortable
        with the settings of the experiment.
      </p>

      <h4>Purpose</h4>
      <p>
        The main purpose of the research is to study participants’ preference
        for using statistical models. We will perform statistical analysis to
        identify and extract patterns in the answers to this survey.
      </p>

      <h4>Procedures</h4>
      <p>
        The study will take approximately 30 minutes and no more than an hour to
        complete. Depending on the treatment group, the procedures are described
        as one of the following: In each scenario, your task is to predict the
        percentile of reading score for a student. You will be presented with
        information about the student. You will repeat this task for 20
        students.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the estimations, you can choose to have either your estimated
        percentiles or the statistical model’s estimated percentile as your
        official estimations. If you choose to use the statistical model’s
        estimates, you will not be able to change the model’s estimates. You
        will make estimates no matter which option you choose.
      </p>

      <h4>Participant Requirements</h4>
      <p>
        Participation in this study is limited to individuals age 18 and older,
        and US residents. Repeated participation is not allowed.
      </p>

      <h4>Risks</h4>
      <p>
        There are no risks for participating in this study beyond those
        associated with normal computer use and a minor risk of breach of
        confidentiality.
      </p>

      <h4>Benefits</h4>
      <p>
        By completing this task, you will be more familiar with statistical
        models used in education setting. More broadly, this study may benefit
        society by improving the understanding of human-computer interaction.
      </p>

      <h4>Compensation & Costs</h4>
      <p>
        You will be paid a flat rate of $2 per participation. Additionally, you
        will be awarded a bonus based on the accuracy of your predictions for 20
        students. The accuracy is calculated as the average of the differences
        between your predictions and the students’ actual percentiles. The bonus
        rule is as below:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          $5 —within 5 percentiles of students’ actual percentiles on average
        </li>
        <li>
          $4 —within 10 percentiles of students’ actual percentiles on average
        </li>
        <li>
          $3 —within 15 percentiles of students’ actual percentiles on average
        </li>
        <li>
          $2 —within 20 percentiles of students’ actual percentiles on average
        </li>
        <li>
          $1 —within 25 percentiles of students’ actual percentiles on average
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>There will be no cost to you if you participate in this study.</p>

      <h4>Future Use of Information</h4>
      <p>
        In the future, once we have removed all identifiable information from
        your data, we may use the data for our future research studies, or we
        may distribute the data to other researchers for their research studies.
        We would do this without getting additional informed consent from you
        (or your legally authorized representative). Sharing of data with other
        researchers will only be done in such a manner that you will not be
        identified.
      </p>

      <h4>Confidentiality</h4>
      <p>
        Other than your Amazon Mechanical Turk serial number, we will collect
        the following demographic information: age, gender, race, level of
        education, and state of residence. We note that the Amazon Mechanical
        Turk serial number could be linked to your public profile page, so you
        might consider what information you choose to share on your public
        profile. These serial numbers will not be shared with anyone outside the
        research team and will only be used to handle financial transactions on
        the platform. Note, however, that de-identified data may be shared
        outside the research team.
      </p>
