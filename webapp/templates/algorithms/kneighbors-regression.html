  <p>
    This algorithm predicts a student's score by taking an average of the scores
    of other students who have similar characteristics.
  </p>

  <h3 id="{{ algo|slugify }}-2">Let's try an example</h3>
  <p>
    To illustrate how it works, let's take the example of predicting the sale
    price of a house listing.
  </p>

  <p>
    This algorithm works similarly to a real estate agent who assesses your
    house and suggests a listing price. You first tell the algorithm/agent all
    the features that you think should be associated with the sales price, such
    as the location, age, size, the surrounding amenities of the house, and so
    on. The agent will identify comparable homes in the same or similar
    neighborhoods with similar age, area, and other features to the place you
    are selling. A reasonable prediction for the price of your house should then
    be the average of the prices of these similar houses. Like the real estate
    agent, this algorithm identifies houses similar to a given house and
    predicts that the house's sale price is an average of the sale prices of all
    those similar houses.

  <p>
    Just like the real estate agent, this algorithm, identifies houses that are
    similar to a given house, and predicts that the sale price of the house is
    an average of the price of all those similar houses.
  </p>

  <h3 id="{{ algo|slugify }}-3">Advantages</h3>
  <p>
    The algorithm can <strong>easily explain its predictions</strong> by
    referring to outcomes of similar houses. It can also capture the more
    complicated relationships between the factors and outcomes than linear
    regression algorithms.
  </p>

  <h3 id="{{ algo|slugify }}-4">Disadvantages</h3>
  <p>
    The main drawback of this algorithm is that if we have to predict the price
    for a house like no other, it will be challenging because there are
    <strong>no other "neighbors" that are similar to the house</strong>. As a
    result, it would make a subpar prediction for this outlier.
