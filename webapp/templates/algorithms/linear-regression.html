    <p>
      Linear regression predicts by weighing factors associated with the outcome
      and summing the weighted factors. It is called "linear" because it tries
      to fit a straight line between the characteristics and the predictions.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3 id="{{ algo|slugify }}-2">Let's try an example</h3>
  <div>
    <p class="text-center">
      <img src="/static/img/algorithms/simple-linear-regression.jpg" alt="" />
    </p>

    <p>
      To illustrate how it works, let's take the example of predicting the sale
      price of a house listing.
    </p>

    <p>
      We first gather all the factors that we think should be associated with
      the sale prices, such as the location, age, size, the surrounding
      amenities of the house, and whether the home has painted walls, and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
      We can then fit a "linear" or a straight line to identify any relationship
      between the factors and the sale prices using the information on houses
      sold in the past.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, if we use only the size of the house, we can see in the graph
      that every additional 100 sqft increases the house price by about
      $100,000. This algorithm might then look like:
    </p>

    <pre><code>Predicted house price = -50,000 + 100,000 * living area in 100 sqft</code></pre>

    <p class="text-center">
      <img src="/static/img/algorithms/linear-regression.jpg" alt="" />
    </p>

    <p>
      So, if the house we want to sell has an area of 1000 sq.ft, the house
      price prediction will be: <br />
      <code
        >-50,000 + 100,000 * 10 (the area of our house in 100 sqft) =
        950,000</code
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, as we consider more factors, the regression equation will be
      more complex, and each factor will have a different weight. For example,
      while a larger area is associated with a price increase, the age of the
      house is associated with a price decrease. Such an algorithm might look
      like this:
    </p>

    <pre><code>Predicted house price = -40,000 + 100,000 * living area - 10,000 * age</code></pre>

    <p>
      So, if the house we want to sell has an area of 1,000 sqft, and is 10
      years old, the predicted house price will be <br />
      <code
        >-40,000 + 100,000 * 10 (the area of our house in 100sqft) - 10,000 * 10
        = 860,000</code
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      Regardless of how many factors we consider, the idea of weighing and
      summing them together to produce a prediction is the same.

  <h3 id="{{ algo|slugify }}-3">Advantages</h3>
  <p>
    The advantage of this algorithm is that it is
    <strong>simple to implement</strong>. It is
    <strong>easy to explain</strong> the predictions of the outcomes by using
    the weights associated with the factors.
  </p>
  <h3 id="{{ algo|slugify }}-4">Disadvantages</h3>
  <p>
    However, because it assumes a straight line can only represent the
    relationship between the factors and the outcome,
    <strong
      >it does not capture more complex relationships like other more
      complicated algorithms do
    </strong>
    if we donâ€™t take care to create hints to the model. For example, a large
    house is good, but if it is located in a cold place, it would require lots
    of heating that can be a burden and decrease its value. Outliers can easily
    influence the algorithm. So if a house for reasons unknown to us is priced
    at an extremely high or low price compared to similar houses, it will
    mislead our algorithm and reduce its performance.
