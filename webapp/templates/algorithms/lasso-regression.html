  <h3 id="{{ algo|slugify }}-1">How does it work?</h3>
  <p>
    This algorithm is a type of
    <a href="#" onclick="handleContent('linear-regression')"
      >linear regression</a
    >. Additionally, if a factor is not important to predicting the outcome, the
    algorithm will ignore its impact on the prediction completely.
  </p>
  <h3 id="{{ algo|slugify }}-2">Let's try an example</h3>
  <p>
    To illustrate how it works, let’s take the example of predicting the sale
    price of a house listing in Ames, Iowa.
  </p>

  <p>
    We first gather a list of all the factors that we think should be associated
    with sale prices. This may include the location, age, size, and surrounding
    amenities of the house and so on. We collect this information for the house
    we are selling and all the houses that were sold in this city in the past.
  </p>

  <p>
    We can then fit a “linear” or a straight line to identify any relationship
    between the factors and the sale prices using information on houses that
    were sold in the past.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, if we use only the size of the house, we can see in the graph
    that every additional 100 sqft increases the house price by about $1,000.
    Additionally if the house has painted walls, it will raise the value by $1.
    A linear regression algorithm might then look like:
  </p>

  <pre><code>Predicted house price = -50,000 + 1000 * sqft + 1 * painted wall</code></pre>

  <p>
    <img src="/static/img/algorithms/lasso-regression.jpg" alt="" />
  </p>

  <p>
    The house we want to sell has an area of 1,000 sqf and painted wallt, so the
    predicted house price is -50,000 + 1,000 * 1,000 (the area of our house) =
    95,001
  </p>

  <p>
    Different from the normal linear regression model, however, this algorithm
    will
    <strong>drop factors that it considers trivial to the prediction</strong>.
    In this case, the algorithm considers the impact of whether the house has
    painted walls on the predictions to be too small, and subsequently drops it
    from its consideration:
  </p>

  <pre><code>Predicted house price = -50,000 + 1000 * sqft</code></pre>

  <p>
    So the house we want to sell will be priced at 95,000 which is similar to
    the original prediction. Although this may seem bad at first because it
    lowers the value slightly, the algorithm can in fact make better predictions
    for many houses because it can focus on finding more meaningful
    relationships between the factors and price by ignoring trivial factors.
  </p>

  <h3 id="{{ algo|slugify }}-3">Advantages</h3>
  <p>
    The advantage of this algorithm is that it is
    <strong>simple to implement</strong> and
    <strong>easy to explain</strong> the predictions of the outcome by using the
    weights associated with each factors.
    <strong
      >It performs better than linear regression when there are outliers</strong
    >. Because the algorithm disregards information it deems unimportant,
    <strong>it generalizes and performs better</strong> for houses it has never
    seen than linear regression.
  </p>
  <h3 id="{{ algo|slugify }}-4">Disadvantages</h3>
  <p>
    However, it suffers from the same drawbacks as
    <a href="#" onclick="handleContent('linear-regression')"
      >linear regression</a
    >. Because it arbitrarily drops factors that do not contribute to the
    performance of the prediction, it
    <strong
      >may drop factors that you may feel should be part of the consideration
      regardless</strong
    >. For example, the algorithm will think whether the house has painted walls
    does not matter to the sales price. However, you may personally feel very
    strongly about it and would like to include it in your decision-making
    anway. <strong>It is slightly more difficult to interpret</strong> than
    linear regression because we need justification for why some factors are
    excluded, but easier than other models.
